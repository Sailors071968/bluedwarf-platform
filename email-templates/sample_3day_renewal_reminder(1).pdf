🚨 URGENT: Slot Loss Warning
CRITICAL: If your subscription goes unpaid, you will immediately and
permanently lose your slot. There is NO GUARANTEE you can get it
back - you will be placed at the end of the waiting list behind other
professionals.
Other professionals are actively waiting to take your exact slot in
78701, 78702. Once lost, your slot may be gone forever.
Don't risk losing months of lead generation and your competitive
position!

• ✅ Professional Profile Visibility with your photo and credentials
• ✅ Direct Client Contact - phone and email displayed
• ✅ Lead Generation - continuous flow of potential clients

⚠️ What Happens If You Don't Renew
• ❌ Immediate Slot Loss - your slots will be given to waiting
professionals within 24 hours
• ❌ No Guaranteed Re-entry - you'll be placed at the END of the
waiting list
• ❌ Profile Removal - clients won't be able to find you
• ❌ Lead Loss - no more client inquiries through BlueDwarf
• ❌ Competitive Disadvantage - other professionals will take your
place permanently
• ❌ Lost Investment - months of lead generation and positioning
wasted
🚨 Slot Scarcity Reality
Remember: We only allow 5 professionals per zip code. Your slot is
extremely valuable and other qualified professionals are waiting to
take it. Once you lose your slot, there's no guarantee when (or if)
another will become available.
Keep My Subscription Active Cancel Before Renewal
Important: After August 12, 2025, cancellation will only take effect at the
end of the next billing cycle.
