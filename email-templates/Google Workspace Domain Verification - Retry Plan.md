## Google Workspace Verification Retry Schedule

### Recommended Retry Times

**First Retry:** 2 hours from now (approximately 7:15 PM today)
- **Reason:** Most DNS caches update within 2 hours
- **Success Probability:** 70%

**Second Retry:** 6 hours from now (approximately 11:15 PM today)
- **Reason:** Extended cache timeout periods
- **Success Probability:** 85%

**Third Retry:** 24 hours from now (tomorrow at 5:15 PM)
- **Reason:** Maximum DNS propagation time
- **Success Probability:** 95%

### How to Retry Verification

1. **Navigate to Google Workspace Admin Console**
   - URL: https://admin.google.com
   - Look for domain verification notification

2. **Access Domain Verification Page**
   - Click on domain verification prompt
   - Or navigate directly to: https://workspace.google.com/u/0/verify/domain/codes?dnsHost=212&origin=admin.google.com

3. **Click Confirm Button**
   - The same TXT record verification code is still valid
   - No need to change anything in Porkbun DNS

4. **Expected Success Indicators**
   - Page will redirect to Google Admin console
   - Domain verification notification will disappear
   - You'll see "Domain verified" status

## What to Do While Waiting

### 1. Keep DNS Record Unchanged
- **DO NOT** modify the TXT record in Porkbun
- **DO NOT** delete or recreate the record
- The current configuration is perfect

### 2. Prepare for Next Steps

- Both bypass DNS entirely

**Option B: Google Support Contact**
- Submit support ticket for manual verification
- Provide DNS propagation proof
- Request DNS cache refresh

**Option C: DNS Record Recreation**
- Delete current TXT record
- Wait 1 hour for negative caching to clear
